# Logo Equality

The absence of the 'Bedrock Edition' caption on the logo of non-Java versions of MC, unlike the Java Edition, is a peculiar omission. This mod seeks to rectify that.

In context, some may perceive this absence as a strategic move by Microsoft to elevate Bedrock Edition as the 'main game,' given their ownership and greater control over Bedrock compared to Mojang. While admittedly a nitpicky argument, this repository serves as both an example and an archive.

Currently compatible with Minecraft Forge/NeoForge/Fabric/Quilt 1.20.4, this mod reinstates the logo to its original state, preserving its former glory.
